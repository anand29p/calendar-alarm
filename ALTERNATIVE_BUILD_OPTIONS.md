# Alternative Ways to Build the APK

If you don't have a computer with enough resources to install Java and the Android SDK, here are some alternatives to build the APK:

## 1. Use an Online Android Build Service

Several online services allow you to build Android apps without installing anything locally:

### AppCircle
- Upload the project to [AppCircle](https://appcircle.io/)
- They provide cloud-based build environments
- Free tier available for basic builds

### Bitrise
- [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/) offers cloud-based Android builds
- Upload the project and configure the build workflow
- Free tier available for open source projects

### GitHub Actions
- If you push this project to GitHub, you can use GitHub Actions to build the APK
- Create a workflow file like this in `.github/workflows/android.yml`:

```yaml
name: Android CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: gradle
    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x gradlew
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: app-release
        path: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

## 2. Use Android Studio on a Cloud VM

### Google Cloud Shell
- [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) provides a free VM with development tools
- Includes Android development tools
- 5GB of persistent storage

### Gitpod
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) provides cloud development environments
- Can be configured for Android development
- Free tier available with limited hours

## 3. Use a Mobile App Builder Service

For a simpler approach, you could recreate the core functionality using a no-code/low-code platform:

### AppGyver
- [AppGyver](https://www.appgyver.com/) is a no-code platform that can create apps with similar functionality
- Free for personal use
- Can integrate with Google Calendar

### Thunkable
- [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com/) allows building mobile apps without coding
- Has components for calendar integration and notifications

## 4. Find a Developer or Friend with Resources

- Share this project with someone who has the necessary resources
- They can build the APK and send it to you
- Make sure to provide them with your own `google-services.json` file for Google Calendar integration

## 5. Use a Rental Cloud Service

- Services like [Shadow](https://shadow.tech/) or [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) rent powerful computers by the hour
- Install Android Studio temporarily to build the APK
- More cost-effective than upgrading your hardware

## Important Note

When using any third-party service to build your APK, be cautious about:
1. Your Google API credentials in the `google-services.json` file
2. Any signing keys you create
3. Privacy policies of the service you're using

For the most secure approach, use a trusted service and replace sensitive credentials after building.
